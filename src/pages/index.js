        <p>Welcome to the Hackerspace Mumbai blog where we share our learnings and experiences in building the largest OSS community in Mumbai.</p>

        What we do</h2>
<p>The mandate we have set for ourselves is to increase the knowledge level of technology at all skill levels in Mumbai, providing a platform for folks to showcase and share their knowledge and experience.</p>


<h3>1. Mumbai Technology Meetup #mumtechup </h3>
      
    <p>A monthly meetup usually consisting of 3-4 sessions revolving around a theme. The themes for the first quarter of 2020:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>January: Golang and Frontend Technology</li>
        <li>February: IoT</li>
        <li>March: DevOps</li>
      </ul>


    The session is usually aimed at folks with intermediate experience but we reserve a few places for freshers.
    
<h3>2. Freecodecamp</h3>

    One of our core goal is to enable folks from all walks of life to be able to code and in this we found freecodecamp an ideological ally and a superlative resource. Most of our meetups have a dedicated session for folks undertaking the freeCodeCamp challenges so that they can share and encourage each other's progress towards being a full stack developer.

<h3>3. Protoschool</h3>

    Being an OSS community, we believe that privacy is an inviolable right of an individual and to this end, we support and work towards a decentralized web. Along with freeCodeCamp, we host Protoschool sessions for enabling folks to take their first steps into #dWeb.

<h3>4. Bootcamps & Hackathons</h3>

    If you go by last few year analytics, our most sought after events are bootcamps which comprises of day long coding sessions. These are usually theme based like cloud, #AI, #MixedReality etc. Also we partner with MLH to conduct hackathons, giving special emphasis on student participation.
